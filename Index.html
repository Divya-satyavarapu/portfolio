      I'm a curious and motivated Python developer who loves building real-world solutions using code. Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving machine learning, deep learning, and computer vision, and I enjoy turning complex problems into working applications especially using Python frameworks like TensorFlow, FastAPI, and OpenCV. With a solid grasp of data structures, algorithms, and cloud concepts, I thrive in collaborative environments and am always looking to learn something new or take on a challenge.
